                    <br>3) Jack/Queen/King count as 10
                    <br>4) Aces count as 1 or 11 depending on the sum of your hand
                    <br>5) If you have an ace and a card with a value of 10 that's a Blackjack and you win!

                    1) Once the initial hands have been dealt, without a Blackjack, the game moves to phase two
                    <br>2) You now have a choice to hit (add another card to your hand) or stand
                    <br>3) It's a good idea to look at the dealer's shown card and strategize
                    <br>4) Once you are happy with your hand you can stand and the winner is decided

                <p class="rules-paragraph">
                    1) Before deciding the winner the dealer must hit or stand
                    <br>2) The dealer has to hit on 16 no matter what
                    <br>3) Once the dealer has finished the player with the highest hand under 21 wins!

                <p class="rules-paragraph">1) To start the game, click on the start game button<br>2) This game uses only one
                    deck with two hands of two cards dealt to the player and dealer
                    <br>3) The goal of Blackjack is to get your hand as close to 21 without going over
                    <br>4) You are playing against the dealer so whoever has the highest hand, without going bust (over
                    21), wins the hand!
                    <br>5) Picture cards, Jack/Queen/King, count as 10 so a hand of 10 of Hearts and King of Spades will
                    equate to 20
                    <br>6) Aces can count as 11 or 1 depending on the sum of your hand, this is done automatically
                    <br>7) If your hand consists of one card equal to 10 and an Ace you just got a Blackjack and instantly
                    win the round!
                    <br>8) Unless the dealer has a Blackjack too, in which case the hand is a draw

                    <br>3) Hit will add another card from the deck to your hand
                    <br>4) You can hit as many times as you want but be careful, you don't want to go bust!
                    <br>5) Once you're happy with your hand you can stand
                    <br>6) It's a good idea to look at the card the dealer is showing and strategize
                    <br>7) If the dealer is showing a 10 and your hand adds up to 16 it would be a good idea to hit
                    <br>8) Although if the dealer's showing a 4 it might not be such a good idea to hit

                    winner is decided
                    <br>2) However, first the dealer must either hit or stand
                    <br>3) The dealer has to hit on 16 and can not strategize by looking at the player's hand
                    <br>4) Even if the player goes bust the dealer must hit until his hand is equal to at least 17
                    <br>5) If both the dealer and player go bust the round is a draw
                    <br>6) If either the dealer or player go bust whilst the other's hand is equal to or less than 21 the
                    busted player loses
                    <br>7) If both hands are less than or equal to 21 the winner is decided by the higher hand
                    <br>8) Once the round is over the score is tallied and you can click the button to play again
